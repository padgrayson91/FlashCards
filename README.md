# FlashCards
FlashCards is a simple Android app designed to allow a user to create custom flash cards to study whatever topic he or she wishes.
The decks of cards are stored as JSON blobs inside files on the Android system to allow for persistence and portability.


## Roadmap
Future objectives for the project include:
  * A scoring algorithm to maximize learning based on frequency of correct vs. incorrect guesses
  * Different card types, such as multiple choice, true/false, and free response
  * A rich UI to give users positive feedback to aid in learning
  * A web tool to allow users to create and view flashcards online and transfer them to the app
  * Different play modes, such as timed play and sudden death
